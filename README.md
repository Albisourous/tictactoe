# Tic-Tac-Toe

A Tic-Tac-Toe game made using Java and Eclipse.

## Background

My first programming project, before I knew proper practice or even how to use loops. The code is inefficient, difficult to read, and overall confusing; however I believe it is good to look back on previous projects and see my growth. 

## Features
```
Player vs Player: The classic tic-tac-toe with "X's" and "O's." It is played in a first to 3.
Player vs CPU (easy): If the player does not have an opponent then they can play against an AI which is coded with very simple logic. 
CPU vs CPU: If the player is tired then they can make the AI play tic-tac-toe vs each other.

## Reflection

The Tic-Tac-Toe project taught me many new things about coding that I did not know before. The first thing I learned from this project was how to use math to find the perfect place to put buttons, text fields, etc. My field was 600 x 760 and I had to make it so it would fit 9 tic-tac-toe tiles, 6 buttons, and a giant text field. After that I learned how to make a Jbutton change text when clicked. This was good, but the next thing I learned is how to check if the button is blank before pressing on it, so the player can not go over a filled tile. Next I learned how to check if the tiles were full of the right text “x” or “o” to make sure someone won. Next I learned how to create a reset button that reset all of the text and number of turns. I set a limit on the number of turns so after 9 turns it would be a draw, and ended the game at 3 wins. After that was done the game worked fine, but now I had to do all of the extra stuff to get 100%. The first thing I programmed was the player vs Bot, I did this by creating a random number between 1-9 and placing an “o” on that tile. But one issue with this bot was that it would replace the “x” that the player put, so had to check if the tile was empty first and if not, make the random number run again until it gets an empty slot. Then used that concept to make bot vs bot. I then made the winning 3 lines of diagonal red when the person won and reset the text after the game reset. The last thing that I added to my program was the sound where I had to get a mp3 to wav converter and find a code on “Google”. I edited the code to work with the songs I wanted randomly and after that I was done.
