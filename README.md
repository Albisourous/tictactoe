# Tic-Tac-Toe

A Tic-Tac-Toe game made using Java and Eclipse.

## Background

My first programming project, before I knew proper practice or even how to use loops. The code is inefficient, difficult to read, and overall confusing; however I believe it is good to look back on previous projects and see my growth. 

## Features
```
Player vs Player: The classic tic-tac-toe with "X's" and "O's." It is played in a first to 3.
Player vs CPU (easy): If the player does not have an opponent then they can play against an AI which is coded with very simple logic. 
CPU vs CPU: If the player is tired then they can make the AI play tic-tac-toe vs each other.
